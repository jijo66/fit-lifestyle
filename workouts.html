<p> Here at fit lifestyle we want you to love working out. we want you to actually look forward to doing it! The best workout tip
We can give you is this:<strong>You have to find something that you like</strong> You could join the gym and spend lots of money paying for 
your membership but if you don't enjoy it chances are that you won't keep it up for long. Exercise doesn't have to be done in the gym. It doesn't have 
to be expensive and boring. That's what fit lifestyle wants to show you. Our workouts of the week section will be updated weekly showing you some fun ways to get in shape</p>
<h3>Workouts of the week</h3>
<h4>Walking</h4>
<figure><img src="images/walking.jpg" alt="walking"/>
<figcaption>Walking is one of the easiest exercises you can do<span class="photocredit">[photographer: George Gitau]</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> It doesn't get any simpler than this. Walking is an ideal exercise for weight loss. It doesn not require any equipment other than a decent pair of walking shoes and you 
don't need a gym membership to do it. 
<p> It's a low impact exercise which means it won't damage your knees and is unlikely to cause any injuries. For people who are stuggling to ovvercome obesity, walking is a nice way to start 
the journey towards a fit-lifestyle. Begin with small changes to your daily routine:
<ol>
<li>Take the stairs instead of the elevator to your office</li>
<li>Alight one stage from your destination and walk</li>
<li>Park at the furthest end of the parking lot</li>
<li>Go for nature hikes over the weekend with your family or friends</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on how much you weigh, walking at a pace of four miles per hour will burn between 5 and 8 calories every minute, or between 225 and 360 calories for a 45-minute walk.
At this pace, walking 45 minutes a day most days, you can lose up to a pound a week without changing any other habits. So what are you waiting for? start walking!</p>
<h4>swimming</h4>

<p>Swimming is one of the best activities you can do to help you loose weight and stay in top shape. It
can burn anywhere from 400 to 700 calories an hour. Knowing how to swim is also an important lifeskill that 
can potentially save your life or someone else one day.</p>
 <p>Swimming engages all of the major muscle groups, 
from your abdominals and back muscles to your arms, legs, hips and glutes. 
It effectively compliments other exercises, like running and walking, or it can be your sole form of fitness. Swimming is a fun activity among kenyans and you are sure
to find a local swimming pool where you stay particularly in the big cities</p>
<h4>Cycling</h4>

<figcaption>Cycling can be awesome in a group as these guys show<span class="photocredit">[photographer: George Gitau]</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bicycling is another low-impact, high-rewards activity for losing weight.
Cycling can burn anywhere from 372 to over 1,100 calories per hour, depending on your weight, your speed and the terrain you’re biking across.</p>
<p>Unlike running, cycling is easy on the joints, and even the most out-of-shape beginner can hop on a bicycle and ride several miles without feeling like they’ve just been through hell.
Outdoor cycling is best, because the varied terrain enables you to get a well-rounded workout that includes strengthening your lower body and getting a good cardiovascular workout.
If you live in a dangerous neighbourhood, consider a stationary bike</p>
<h4>Running</h4>

<figcaption>Kenyans love to run. If you want to loose weight so should you!<span class="photocredit">[photographer: George Gitau]</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Kenya is known for its renowned marathon runners. Have you ever seen an overweight runner? That's because it works.
 Running burns about 600 calories per hour, helps build strong bones and connective tissue and gets your heart pumping at a healthy rate
 to jelp prevent heart disease, stroke and certain cancers.</p>
 <p>The only equipment running requires is a good pair of shoes to protect your joints and, if it helps you keep the pace and maintain motivation, an iPod with your favourite tunes
 and your're good to go.</p>
 <p>Start with walking first and gradually build up to running. Running is also good if you have a running partner to help push you.
 Experts now recommend that you don’t stretch before you run. Instead, warm up by marching in place, bringing your knees up high, or walking for five minutes before beginning your run.</P>
 <h4>High Intensity Interval training</h4>

</figure>
<p>
This is one of the most effective weight loss exercise options available.
You only need to engage in this form of exercise for about 20 minutes, three times a week, 
to get incredible benefits that include burning a large number of calories and ramping up your metabolism in the wake of the afterburn.</P>
<p>High intensity interval workouts can be done with many forms of exercise, and consist of short but intense bursts of activity followed by a lower-intensity period or a period of complete rest.
For example if you are running, you would for example sprint for 100m and then jog for a while as you catch your breath before sprinting again</p>
<p>High intensity interval training, or HIIT, offers amazing benefits. Not only will you progress much faster to your desired fitness level, 
you will also improve your aerobic capacity. In fact, after only two weeks of HIIT, your aerobic capacity will be stronger.
than if you had completed eight weeks of steady-state endurance exercise, such as running.</p>
