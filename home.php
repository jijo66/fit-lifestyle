<h2>"Welcome to the Fit lifestyle!"</h2>
<h3>Let's face it Obesity is becoming a serious problem!</h3>
<p> we thought it was a western problem but obesity is seriously starting to affect us right here in kenya.
We're eating more friez for lunch, we're spending our days seated in traffic and at the office, we take the elevator etc. I could go on and on
but the reality is we're are seriously inviting health troubles into our lives unless we change</p>
