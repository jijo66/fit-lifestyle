<figcaption>Peter mwashumbe has always been overweight."For as lonfg as i can remember I have always been big. Being from coast it was really embarrasing having to swim with a tshirt on. My friends always used to make fun of me. I thought there was nothing i could do about it until i discovered 
fit lifestyle. Seeing kenyans just like me change their lives ignitted in me a fire i cannot describe. The nutrition and workout tips definitely helped me and the motivation stories and pictures helped me stay strong. If it wasn't for fit lifestyle i'd still be that big guy swimming with a tshirt at the gym.
